Hey guys, I'm Alex.

I'm a computer science grad student passionate about AI and ML. My interests are broad and cover a variety of areas in AI, but are mainly related to model robustness and interpretability. I sometimes ponder automating my own work and making myself obsolete, but I hope to never achieve such a thing!
I'm currently working on projects involving model robustness, specfically with respect to adversarial examples as this is an area of ML that touches
on understanding what models learn from both an analytical and philosophical perspective.
