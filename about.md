Hey guys, I'm Alex.

I'm a computer science grad student and fitness enthusiast. My interests are broad and cover a variety of areas in AI, body augmentation, and 
the effects of physical exercise. I sometimes ponder automating my own work and making myself obsolete, but I hope to never achieve such a thing!
I'm currently working on projects involving model robustness, specfically with respect to adversarial examples as this is an area of ML that touches
on understanding what models learn from both an analytical and philosophical perspective.
