Hello world!

Welcome to my tech and fitness blog. For tech, I will be writing tutorials about how to implement cool machine learning models that can be found
in recent, game-changing publications. I'll also be discussing general front end web development, though that will come later as I am making the change from Angular 1 to 4. 

For fitness, I will share workout routines that I have created over the years, as well as the results that I've experienced from different training approaches when it comes to varying TUT, load, explosiveness, and so on. Additionally, I will review popular Beachbody workout programs such as Insanity, P90X, 22 Minute Hard Corps, P90X3, and individual routines from other programs.

I'm exicted to share my knowledge with you all, and I hope to inspire you about the usefulness of ML and the importance of fitness!
