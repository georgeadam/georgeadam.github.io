I’m a computer science grad student passionate about AI and ML. My interests are broad and cover a variety of areas in AI, but are mainly related to model robustness and interpretability. I sometimes ponder automating my own work and making myself obsolete, but I hope to never achieve such a thing! I’m currently working on projects focusing on the robust deployment of models, specfically with respect to shifting data, and harmful, model-induced bias as this is a research area crucial for enabling high-stakes industries like healthcare to adopt ML.
